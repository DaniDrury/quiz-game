# Coding Quiz Game

## Description
This a short, timed, quiz game that saves scores on local storage for display in a "High Scores" section.
As a coding bootcamp student, I created this quiz as a means of practicing DOM navigation and manipulation using Javascript.
I created and removed elements, set element attributes, and stored and pulled data from the browser's local storage.
